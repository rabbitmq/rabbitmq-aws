# rabbitmq-aws

## This was migrated to https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

This repository has been moved to the main unified RabbitMQ "monorepo", including all open issues. You can find the source under [/deps/rabbitmq_aws](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/master/deps/rabbitmq_aws).
All issues have been transferred.

## Overview

A fork of [gmr/httpc-aws](https://github.com/gmr/httpc-aws) for use in building RabbitMQ plugins that interact with Amazon Web Services APIs.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gmr/rabbitmq-aws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gmr/rabbitmq-aws)

## Supported Erlang Versions

[Same as RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html)
 
## Configuration

Configuration for *rabbitmq-aws* is can be provided in multiple ways. It is designed
to behave similarly to the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
with respect to providing region and configuration information. Additionally it
has two methods, ``rabbitmq_aws:set_region/1`` and ``rabbitmq_aws:set_credentials/2``
to allow for application specific configuration, bypassing the automatic configuration
behavior.

### Configuration Precedence

The configuration values have the following precedence:

 - Explicitly configured via API
 - Environment variables
 - Configuration file
 - EC2 Instance Metadata Service where applicable

### Credentials Precedence

The credentials values have the following precedence:

 - Explicitly configured via API
 - Environment variables
 - Credentials file
 - EC2 Instance Metadata Service
 
### Environment Variables

As with the AWS CLI, the following environment variables can be used to provide 
configuration or to impact configuration behavior:

 - ``AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE``
 - ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION``
 - ``AWS_CONFIG_FILE``
 - ``AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE``
 - ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``
 - ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
 
## API Functions
 
  Method                                | Description
 ---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ``rabbitmq_aws:set_region/1``          | Manually specify the AWS region to make requests to.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:set_credentials/2``     | Manually specify the request credentials to use.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:refresh_credentials/0`` | Refresh the credentials from the environment, filesystem, or EC2 Instance Metadata service.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:get/2``                 | Perform a GET request to the API specifying the service and request path.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:get/3``                 | Perform a GET request specifying the service, path, and headers.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:post/4``                | Perform a POST request specifying the service, path, headers, and body.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:request/5``             | Perform a request specifying the service, method, path, headers, and body.
 ``rabbitmq_aws:request/6``             | Perform a request specifying the service, method, path, headers, body, and ``httpc:http_options().``
 ``rabbitmq_aws:request/7``             | Perform a request specifying the service, method, path, headers, body,  ``httpc:http_options()``, and override the API endpoint. 
 

## Example Usage

The following example assumes that you either have locally configured credentials or that
you're using the AWS Instance Metadata service for credentials:

```erlang
application:start(rabbitmq_aws).
{ok, {Headers, Response}} = rabbitmq_aws:get("ec2","/?Action=DescribeTags&Version=2015-10-01").
```

To configure credentials, invoke ``rabbitmq_aws:set_credentials/2``:

```erlang
application:start(rabbitmq_aws).

rabbitmq_aws:set_credentials("AKIDEXAMPLE", "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"),

RequestHeaders = [{"Content-Type", "application/x-amz-json-1.0"},
                  {"X-Amz-Target", "DynamoDB_20120810.ListTables"}],
                  
{ok, {Headers, Response}} = rabbitmq_aws:post("dynamodb", "/", 
                                              "{\"Limit\": 20}",
                                              RequestHeaders).
```
